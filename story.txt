Bobby is a sophomore at UW Madison studying computer science. He finally gets to take CS400, a class he's heard many good things about and can't wait to get into. The first few weeks go by fine, but then the first program makes things quite interesting. He's finished up almost all of his code and tests but has a bug that's making a tiny part of his implementation go all wrong.
